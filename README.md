# Simulated Multisensory Integration
This project is the Phase 1 part of the whole Bodily-Self Spiking Neural Computational Model. The goal of this project is to provide a relatively simple and neat environment for the theory exploration. After the exploration, the model will be moved to the real-world robot platform, controlling the real NAO and iCub robots to own bodily-self model.
  
The project contains 3 functional modules: dopamine-based reinforcement learning, multisensory integration, and anomaly detection. The engineering plan of the project is listed below.
